Responsive Breakpoints, based on screen width:
(xs) — screen width < 576px (This is the “default” tier)
sm — screen width ≥ 576px
md — screen width ≥ 768px
lg— screen width ≥ 992px
xl — screen width ≥ 1200px

The Rules of the Grid:

Columns must be the immediate child of a Row.
Rows are only used to contain Columns, nothing else.
Rows should be placed inside a Container.
Those rules are very IMPORTANT. The Rows & Columns always work together, and you should never have one without the other.
Bad stuff will happen if you don’t follow those 3 simple Grid rules, exactly.
